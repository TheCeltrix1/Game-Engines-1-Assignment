# Game-Engines-1-Assignment

**Game Idea**
My assignment concept is to make a music visualiser. A simple concept at first but hard to execute in a satisfactory manner. In an effort to make something that really stands out I thought of real life phenomina that shows a variety of colour. From the Aurora Australis and Borealis showing a dazzling display of colour due to heavy solar radiation, waterfall mist and rainbows. All the way to Galactic Nebulas. Finally after a great deal of brainstorming I ended up on my final iteration. A thunderstorm. Despite what many may feel I think a thunderstorm is a great display of natural beauty and colour played out on a dark backdrop highlighting the colour much more.

**Execution**
In order for me to execute the assignment a few things are needed
1 A murky dark backdrop of sky or city. City could be generated by another students assignment to give a fantastic display for infinite forms once the assignment is complete.
2 A music reader that allows any song to be played and lets the thunderstorm procedurally react in unique ways that are partially randomised so that listening to a repeating song is never quite the same visually.
3 A randomised thunder effect
4 Randomised lighting effects
